# Releasing

This repo uses Changesets to make npm releases reviewable.

## Normal development

For any pull request that changes user-facing behavior, a changeset should be
added before the work is considered ready to release:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

Choose the smallest appropriate bump:

- `patch`: fixes, docs-visible behavior changes, small compatibility work
- `minor`: new features or notable new behavior
- `major`: breaking changes

The generated markdown file in `.changeset/` should explain the release impact in a sentence or two.

PRs that only touch internal tooling or CI can skip a changeset when they do not need an npm release note.

## Who adds the changeset

Maintainers own release metadata.

- For internal PRs, the author can add the changeset directly.
- For external PRs, do not expect the contributor to know or run the Changesets
  workflow. The reviewer or merge maintainer should add the changeset before
  merge, or immediately afterward in a small follow-up PR.
- If a releasable PR lands without a changeset, create a catch-up changeset PR
  before running the release flow.

The practical rule is simple: if the change should appear in npm release notes,
make sure a maintainer gets a `.changeset/*.md` file onto `main`.

## Release flow

1. Merge releasable PRs to `main`
2. Let the `Version Packages` workflow open or update the release PR
3. Add exactly one `<!-- release-rollback-version: X.Y.Z -->` marker to the
   generated changelog section, where `X.Y.Z` is the current npm `latest`
   version
4. Run `npm install --package-lock-only` and verify `package.json`, the root
   lockfile version, and the lockfile root package version all match
5. Approve the bot-authored release PR's GitHub Actions runs, then wait for
   exact-head CI and review gates to pass
6. Review the generated version bump and `CHANGELOG.md`
7. Merge the release PR to `main`
8. Manually trigger the `Publish Package` workflow on the merged release commit
9. Approve the workflow if a protected GitHub Environment is configured
10. Let the workflow:
   - install dependencies
   - run tests
   - publish to npm
   - create tag `vX.Y.Z`
   - create the GitHub release using the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section as the primary notes
   - prepend those notes ahead of GitHub's generated contributor and compare summary
   - dispatch `Publish to ClawHub` for the same tag with `dry_run` set to `false`

## External setup required

The repo-side files are not enough by themselves. A maintainer still needs to configure npm trusted publishing for this GitHub repository/workflow pair.

Recommended external setup:

1. Configure npm trusted publishing for this repo and the `publish.yml` workflow
2. Optionally create a GitHub Environment named `npm-publish` and add required reviewers
3. Confirm the repository label taxonomy used by `.github/release.yml`

When configuring npm trusted publishing, register the GitHub workflow using the exact workflow filename in this repo: `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.

The workflow requests an OIDC identity token, installs an npm CLI with trusted
publishing support, and publishes with provenance. It intentionally does not
inject `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` or use the legacy `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret.

The publish workflow is intentionally manual. Release issuance should stay deliberate even after trusted publishing is enabled.

## ClawHub releases

Publish to npm first. After the npm workflow creates the matching `vX.Y.Z` tag
and GitHub Release, it automatically dispatches `Publish to ClawHub` from that
tag with `release_tag` set to the same tag and `dry_run` set to `false`.

The standalone `Publish to ClawHub` workflow remains available for validation
and recovery. Select the release tag as the workflow ref, set `release_tag` to
the same tag, and use `dry_run` to choose validation or publication.
When recovering after the release workflow itself has changed, select the
default branch as the workflow ref and keep `release_tag` pinned to the release
being recovered. Preflight still resolves that tag and requires its commit to
match npm `gitHead` before publication.

The workflow refuses to publish unless the selected tag, `package.json`
version, npm version, npm `gitHead`, and the tag's immutable commit all identify
the same release. Real ClawHub publishes are serialized. Selecting the release
tag for both the workflow ref and package source lets ClawHub verify that the
trusted workflow commit matches the published package commit. Tags that predate
this workflow cannot use OIDC trusted publishing.

After identity verification, the workflow downloads the exact published npm
tarball and passes that prebuilt artifact to ClawHub. This keeps generated
files such as `dist/index.js` identical between npm and ClawHub even though
`dist/` is excluded from the source tag. Pull-request dry runs build and pack
the checkout before ClawHub validation so they exercise the same artifact
shape as a release.

ClawHub trusted publishing is configured for
`.github/workflows/clawhub-publish.yml`; no long-lived repository token is
required. Deleting that trusted-publisher configuration disables future
publishes.

ClawHub's `latest` tag always follows the highest semantic version for code
plugins, including prereleases. Stable releases therefore request the custom
`stable` tag plus `latest`, while beta releases request `beta` plus `latest`.
ClawHub keeps `stable` on the newest stable artifact and accepts `latest` only
when the candidate is the highest version. This is intentionally independent
of npm, where `latest` remains the stable channel and `beta` remains the beta
channel.

## Beta releases

Use a Changesets prerelease when `main` needs broader testing before a stable release:

1. Run `npx changeset pre enter beta` on the reviewed release branch.
2. Run `npm run version-packages` and refresh `package-lock.json`.
3. Add exactly one `<!-- release-rollback-version: X.Y.Z -->` marker to the
   generated changelog section, where `X.Y.Z` is the current stable `latest`.
4. Review and merge the generated prerelease version and changelog.
5. Dispatch `Publish Package` from the branch containing the exact merged commit.

The publish workflow maps `X.Y.Z-beta.N` to npm's `beta` dist-tag and marks the
GitHub Release as a prerelease. Stable `X.Y.Z` versions map to npm's `latest`
dist-tag. Other prerelease identifiers fail closed.

The workflow pins the dispatch event's immutable commit, serializes publication,
and refuses to move a dist-tag backward. The reviewed changelog commit binds the
exact rollback version across retries. A retry resumes only when any existing
npm version, Git tag, and GitHub Release identities match that commit exactly.

Never use a beta publication to move or repair `latest` manually.

### Promote a beta line to stable

After the beta is accepted for stable release:

1. Run `npx changeset pre exit` on a new release branch from the beta-bearing
   `main` commit.
2. Run `npm run version-packages` and `npm install --package-lock-only`.
3. Add exactly one `<!-- release-rollback-version: X.Y.Z -->` marker to the
   stable changelog section, where `X.Y.Z` is the current npm `latest` version.
4. Verify `package.json`, the root lockfile version, and the lockfile root
   package version all equal the expected stable version, such as `0.14.0`.
5. Review the stable changelog, run `npm run release:verify`, and merge the
   stable release PR only after exact-head CI and review gates pass.
6. Dispatch `Publish Package` from that exact merged stable commit.

The stable publish moves npm's `latest` dist-tag only after the workflow proves
the candidate is newer than the current stable version. Its release notes pin
rollback guidance to the exact prior `latest` version.
